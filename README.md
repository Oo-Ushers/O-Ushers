# OO-Ushers Backend

Express and PostgreSQL API for the OO-Ushers platform. It supports usher and organizer onboarding, profile-completion restrictions, event operations, applications, direct booking invitations, attendance, ratings, warning records, referrals, staff roles, notifications, and admin approvals.

## Local setup

1. Install dependencies with `npm install`.
2. Create `.env` with the required settings below.
3. Start the API with `npm start`. It uses port `4000` by default; the Next.js frontend uses port `3001`.
4. Open `/health` to verify the server and database, or `/docs` for the API reference.

## Paymob Test Mode

The organization settles an event only after it is completed. Every present or late usher receives a settlement line based on the event's per-usher budget. The system records 5% as the OO-Ushers transfer/platform fee and 95% as the usher's amount.

- Ushers with a supported wallet or complete bank payout account are queued for an automatic Paymob Payouts Sandbox transfer after the collection webhook succeeds.
- Ushers without a supported payout account are marked `cash_due`. The Paymob checkout collects only their 5% platform fee; the organization pays their remaining 95% in cash and records it from the event settlement screen.
- The collection callback and card-token callback are SHA-512 HMAC verified. Saved card tokens are encrypted with AES-256-GCM; raw card numbers and CVVs never enter this application.
- Live credentials are rejected. Moving to production requires a deliberate code and configuration change after sandbox acceptance.

For card-on-file testing, ask Paymob to enable a Test Integration ID that enforces card saving. Payouts credentials are issued separately by the Paymob Payouts account manager.

The database startup is backward-compatible with the earlier schema: it adds the new frontend-alignment columns and staff role values when an existing PostgreSQL database is detected. In development, Sequelize also synchronizes model changes.

## Account access rules

- New usher and organizer accounts can browse immediately, but event actions remain locked until all required profile data is complete.
- Ushers must complete their name, photo, city, phone, work cities, languages, and event categories.
- Organizers must complete their company name, logo, description, location, and phone.
- Organizer staff can use their company workspace, but cannot bypass an incomplete or blocked owner account.
- Public signup only permits usher/talent and organizer/provider accounts. Staff and admin roles must be invited.

Frontend role and field names are accepted alongside the backend names. Examples include `talent`/`usher`, `provider`/`organizer`, `Sports Event`/`sport_event`, `experienceYears`/`experience`, and `phoneNumber`/`mobileNumber`.

The usher API is available under both `/usher` and `/talent`; the organizer API is available under both `/organizer` and `/provider`. Responses retain the backend fields and add frontend-friendly aliases such as `_id`, `providerId`, `photo`, `categories`, and `frontendRole`.

## Verification

```sh
npm test
npm run lint
npm run generate:openapi
```

The automated tests cover frontend aliases, profile locks, protected signup roles, event category compatibility, and pagination behavior.
